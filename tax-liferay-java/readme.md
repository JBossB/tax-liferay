# Java Project

To run the program, follow the instructions below in the console:
```
java -jar tax-liferay-java.jar %s where %s is 1,2 or 3
example: java -jar tax-liferay-java 1
```
The program recognizes the initial argument which can be 1, 2 or 3.
Then it brings from ItemShopBasketDummyServiceUtil a list of ItemShopBasket for the exercise. The program prints the impute, then prints the output, calculating the tax.

I did this calculation with a decorator pattern.
